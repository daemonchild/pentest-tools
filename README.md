# pentest-tools

Here are some useful tools that I've written over the years.

I've found that half the battle with pentests is automating as much as possible.
There is always so much output - but what is useful? 
When you've found it, how do you report on it efficiently?

I've written loads of scripts most of which are terrible, and I've been too ashamed to share.
Some of these have been more recently refactored into python tools, some have been tidied to assist my internal pen test team.
So I thought, why not share with the world. :)

## Enumeration

### nmap-to-grep.py

Parser for .nmap files to turn them into useful grepabble output

### gnmap-to-grep.py

Parser for .gnmap files to turn them into actually useful grepabble output


## Exploitation

### Unix - XwatchWin

This is a blast from the past.
I've included a compiled version for Linux.



## Pivoting

### Source Port Tunneller

A wrapper around socat to make tunnelling using a specific source port much easier.
